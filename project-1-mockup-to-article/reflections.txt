You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

  * So far, the course has been fairly easy as I have some limited experience in web developement, and am familar with HTML Syntax. Having said that, I did learn a couple of new things; I'd never come across horizontal rule before!  
  
  * I expect that, if not in the next project, I'll find things hard soon after.

  * Due to the above, it's been hard to not skip through videos. Although I'm pleased to say I watched them all.

  * As I studied Computer Science (BSc) at university, the problem solving strategies covered in the first project come as second nature to me. I certainly used Stack Overflow and Google for this first project.
