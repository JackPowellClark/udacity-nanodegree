# Project Instructions

1. Download and unzip *mockup-to-article.zip* (See the Resources in the top 
right. You'll find *index.html*, the article mockup image (*blog-mockup.pdf* 
and a file called *reflections.txt* inside.

2. Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit *index.html* so 
that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, 
which means that you'll need to research and experiment! (Hint: look up 
"superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough.")

3. When you've finished building the article, open up *reflections.txt*. You've 
learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to 
write down your thoughts about web development in *reflections.txt*. Answer the 
following questions:
    * What new skills have you learned?
    * What has been easy?
    * What has been difficult?
    * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project
      to overcome challenges so far?
